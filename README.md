# Soil Moisture Estimation using Reflected GPS Signals

Investigating the potential for sensing soil moisture with the L-band Reflective GPS Signals<br />

Characterization of sediment surface (properties like humidity) is indeed important to better understand morph dynamic activity of intertidal part of soil. In our approach we compare the direct GPS Signal to Noise Ratio with the reflected one in order to measure the soil moisture<br />

A MAP Estimate of the SNR of the received signal after demodulation and de-multiplexing is proposed. In our case the signal model is a piecewise stationary process with change instants at bit edge position<br />

Preliminary SNR measurements with this technique presented for the discrimination of moist soil<br />
